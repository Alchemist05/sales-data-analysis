# Sales-Data-Analysis
Sales data analysis of Amazon electronics dataset.

We dive into the dataset of electronics sold by Amazon from 1999 to 2018, and build visualizations to get sales insights and convey it to stakeholders in order for them to take decisions based on data. 

## Problem Statement
The goal of this analysis is to clean the dataset, explore and understand sales and customer rating patterns within the Amazon Electronics dataset. The dataset contains product-level information such as brand, category, year, and rating, representing customer interactions with electronic products listed on Amazon.

The main objective is to uncover brand-wise, category-wise, and time-based trends that influence product performance and customer engagement. Specifically, the analysis aims to:
- Identify top-performing brands in terms of total product count and ratings over time.
- Evaluate category-level performance within each brand to determine which product categories drive the most sales or engagement.
- Analyze yearly trends to identify growth patterns and periods of high or low sales activity.
- Study customer ratings distribution across brands and categories to infer brand reputation and consumer satisfaction.
- Visualize comparative insights using plots

This analysis will help derive data-driven insights into consumer behavior and brand performance on Amazon’s electronics marketplace, assisting sellers and analysts in understanding which product lines, brands, and categories are most successful and how their performance evolves over time.

## Insights
After cleaning the dataset, we start building visualizations:

As we can see the proportion of products sold that got 5 stars is significantly higher which indicates healthy quality.
